                <p> My name is Lucy, I studied Mathematics, Computer Science and Physics for A Levels at
                    Woodhouse College. I am now studying Computer Science at City, University of London.
                    In this coding bootcamp, I have learnt that Processing can be used for displaying data and for
                    creating art using shapes or text.</p>

                <p style="align: center">
                    For my project, I have chosen to create a maze game. The aim of the game is to
                    get to the end of the maze without touching the bouncing balls.
                    I started off by using classes for the player, the balls and the walls of the maze.
                    I used methods to draw and display the objects on the screen and arrays to store
                    the objects such as the balls and the walls. Thank you for checking out my project
                    and I hope you enjoy the game. :)
